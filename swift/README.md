# Zipline Swift Assignment

This is the Zipline Swift take home coding exersize.

Here's what we're looking for in this exersize:

- Are you able to quickly ship a working product?
- Are you able to make decisions on what to include in the scope, and what to
  not work on? How do you make the decisions? You'll get a lot of autonomy in
  your work, and we want to see how you align your work and priorities.
- Are you able to clearly communicate your work and decisions, make it easy for
  the team to pick up your work, run it on their laptops? We work remotely, so
  clear written communication is extremely important for us.
- Is your code clean, readable, and maintainable? Do you follow sane best
  practices (architectures, handling errors, using linters).

## Zipmovies â€” a movie database browser app

You'll build a small Swift application that will a list of movies, populated
from a
[TMDB REST API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-top-rated-movies).

#### Requirements

- App has a screen with a list of movie cards the user can scroll through.
  Pagination (load more movies when the user scrolls down) is required.
- Each movie should be presented with a card containing it's image cover, title,
  rating, and release year.
- The app must have an affordance (a secret jesture like 3 finger double tap, or
  a button in a nav bar, that doesn't matter) that would switch between
  endpoints: top rated movies, popular movies, and recently released movies.
- The app must compile and run in a simulator for iOS 14 on a out-of-the-box
  Macbook and XCode 12.5.

#### What's not required

- You don't have to implement offline support and images caching, but if you
  know how to do it quickly, that would be a plus.
- You can use any ready-made UI assets, or not style the app at all. An unstyled
  app that works is better than a nice looking app that doesn't.

#### Other constraints

- You can use SwiftUI or UIKit and target any stable version of iOS.
- You'll provision your own TMDB API keys. Feel free to hardcode the keys in
  your code.
- You can use any opensource libraries you want, as long as they're licensed
  under MIT, BSD, Apache 2, or other permissive license. If you choose to use
  any libraries, please explain why you picked the ones you decided to use.

### Submitting your work

When you're done, you can either invite us to a private github repository
(@nategadzhi) with admin rights, so we can share the repo with the interviewing
team that will review it with me, or just archive the app and send us a zip
archive. Please include instructions on how to build and run the app, any
additional notes and caveats in a README.md in the submission.

Once you send us the app, expect to hear back from us in 3 work days.
